[![Downloads this Month](https://img.shields.io/packagist/dm/smashed-egg/laravel-console.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/smashed-egg/laravel-console)


This package allows you to enhance your Console Commands by making it easier to:

- Add aliases 
- Use interactive functionality (Since writing this a similar feature exist in Laravel 10.x).
- Making repetitive tasks easier via Traits (Concerns) to drop in extra functionality for your commands.

You can still use this functionality in your current console commands, as Symfony provides this functionality.

The purpose of this package is to make its usage more Laravel like.
